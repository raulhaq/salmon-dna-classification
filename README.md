# Salmon DNA Classification 🧬🐟

This project aims to classify the health status of salmon (healthy or diseased) using DNA sequence data.

## Project Status
🚧 Still in development — the model is not final.

## How to Run
1. Install requirements:
`numpy==1.24.3
tensorflow==2.13.0`

3. Run training: `python main.py`

## Dataset
Custom salmon DNA dataset (not publicly released yet).

## Goals
- Preprocess DNA sequences
- Build CNN/LSTM or other models
- Evaluate classification accuracy
